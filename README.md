# EWB_Openhack2019
A communication platform for Engineers Without Borders (EWB) Openhack 2019 challenge.

## Challenge objective
A platform for storing and exchanging information between EWB Sweden and their project beneficiaries that would reduce the
likelihood of abandoned systems that fall into disrepair.

## Our Solution: EWBFlow
### Description
We built a mobile app synced with a browser version that leverages existing open source communication platforms. Our mobile app, which we named **EWBFlow**, addresses all the requriements of the EWB challenge:
1. it is available both online and offline, where syncing happens when the user connects to the internet,
2. it contains a Wiki page, specific to each project, where engineers can upload manuals, maps, sketches or any other kinds of supplementary and teaching material,
3. it contains a support forum, specific to each project, where enginners (both local as well as the remote ones) can ask and answer questions, upload images and videos,
4. it supports chat and video call functionallities, 
5. it contains a global forum for sharing information and insights gained from the past projects categorised by the content.

### Tools used
In particular, we used [Question2Answer](https://www.question2answer.org/) for maintaining a knowledge sharing community where users can ask or answer questions, and added a [Conversejs](https://conversejs.org/) chat add-on that enables users to get into direct contact with another engineer. Question2Answer Platform enables categorising, commenting and upvoting the comments.
